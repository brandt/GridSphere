	Building the GridSphere Distribution
==================================================


Requirements
------------

1) Building the GridSphere distribution requires JDK 1.4.2 
(JDK 1.4.1 ships with a broken xalan.jar). You will also need Ant 1.6+ 
available at http://jakarta.apache.org/ant. 

2) You will also need a Tomcat 4.1+ or Tomcat 5.0.25+ servlet container 
available at http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat. In addition to providing
a hosting environment for GridSphere, Tomcat provides some of the required 
XML (JAR) libraries that are needed for compilation.

Compiling and Deploying
-----------------------

The Ant build script, build.xml, uses the build.properties file to specify any
compilation options. Edit build.properties appropriately for your needs.

At this point, simply invoking "ant install" will deploy the GridSphere portlet 
container to Tomcat using the default database. Please see the User Guide for more details on configuring the database.


The build.xml supports the following basic tasks:

install -- builds and deploys GridSphere, makes the documentation and
           installs the database

clean -- removes the build and dist directories including all the
	 compiled classes

update -- updates the existing source code from CVS

compile -- compiles the GridSphere source code 

deploy -- deploys the GridSphere framework and all portlets to a
	  Tomcat servlet container located at $CATALINA_HOME

create-database - creates a new, fresh database with original
                 GridSphere settings, this wipes out your current database!

docs -- builds the Javadoc documentation from the source code

To see all the targets invoke "ant --projecthelp".

2) Read the documentation found at  
http://www.gridsphere.org/gridsphere/gridsphere?cid=docs
for more information on using and developing portlets with  GridSphere.

3) Startup Tomcat and then go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/gridsphere/gridsphere
to see the portal!
