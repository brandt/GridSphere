<b>Portlet Event API Implementation</b>
<p>
Portlet events are a part of the Portlet API and permit actions to be
genererated by the portlet container when a change of state occurs in the
portlet window, a message is sent to another portlet, or a portlet action
is performed. The {@link org.gridsphere.portlet.AbstractPortlet}
provides base implementations of the portlet event listener methods and should
be overriden for particular event handling.
<p>
The current component event implementations are:
<ul>
<li>{@link org.gridsphere.event.impl.ActionEventImpl}</li>
<li>{@link org.gridsphere.event.impl.MessageEventImpl}</li>
<li>{@link org.gridsphere.event.impl.WindowEventImpl}</li>
</ul>
