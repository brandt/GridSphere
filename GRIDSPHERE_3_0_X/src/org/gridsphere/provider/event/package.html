<b>UI Form Event API</b>
<p>
The {@link org.gridsphere.provider.event.FormEvent} decorates the
{@link org.gridsphere.event.ActionEvent} by providing a forms-based library for accessing and
creating "visual beans" that can be used by the GridSphere UI tag library to create more sophisticated
presentation.
