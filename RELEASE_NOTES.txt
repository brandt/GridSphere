RELEASE NOTES

Gridsphere 3.2
==============

GridSphere now supports single sign-on with Shibboleth and x.509 certificates

GridSphere 3.1
==============

All custom settings in the portal are now stored by default in ~/.gridsphere of the user
who started the server. You can change that by setting a JNDI variable in tomcat called
'gridspheresettingsdir' to override that location.

GridSphere 3.0.8
================

Due to some class loading issues, most of the files are now copied to the shared lib of tomcat 5.x.

* Upgrading

  Since the loading of classes changed it is needed to install a fresh version of GridSphere and tomcat. It is always
  recommended to run GridSphere in it's own Servlet Container (Tomcat 5.x is supported). To migrate your settings
  to the new instance copy your $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/gridsphere/WEB-INF/CustomPortal directory to the new destination.
  Be aware that if you are using the buildin hsqldb you might need to change the DB path in hibernate.properties (or
  just save it and install the new version in the same location).

* 3rd party GridSphere Style projects

  You need to upgrade your build files for your gridsphere based projects. To do that run the command

     ant update-project

  in the source directory of GridSphere and answer the questions. The need to duplicate some files in the WEB-INF/lib
  directory of your projects is gone since they are all available from the servlet containers classloader. If you don't
  use our build scripts just make sure you have 'gridsphere-portletservlet-VERSION.jar' in you WEB-INF/lib directory.
  That's all you need.
